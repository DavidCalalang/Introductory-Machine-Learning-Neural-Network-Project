# Introductory-Machine-Learning-Neural-Network-Project
This is a Machine Learning project that was created for one of my classes. It primarily focused on employing a Neural Network through the Tensorflow library and training that model on a dataset of flights data. Standard Neural Network techniques such as the use of a training and testing split, and validating the trained model were used.
